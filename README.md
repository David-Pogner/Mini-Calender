# Mini Calender

## Introduction


This is a simple calender application. It was made with JavaScript, so the date updates itself.

 * **Note that the time is switched to ```Central European```. You can therefore have slight deviations depending on where you run this program
 **

* **The project consists of three files. An HTML file to insert the graphics, a CSS file to format the graphics correctly and a JS file to make the website dynamic
